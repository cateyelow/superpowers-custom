## Output contract (follow exactly)

Write your findings to the report path given above, as a plain-text list. Use
this exact record shape, one blank line between records:

```
DEFECT <n>
what: <one line — the user-visible problem>
where: <file:line, or a CSS selector / element description>
repro: <how you observed it — the steps or the measurement>
severity: blocking | minor
category: a11y | contrast | touch-target | responsive | state | logic | spec
```

Rules:
- Report only defects you actually observed or measured. Do not speculate.
- "blocking" = a user cannot complete the task, loses data, or cannot perceive
  or operate a control. Everything else is "minor".
- One record per distinct defect. Do not merge two problems into one record.
- If you find nothing, write exactly: NO DEFECTS FOUND
- Your final reply to me must be ONLY the number of defects you wrote, e.g. `7`.
  The report file is the deliverable.
