# Pre-ship review

You are reviewing a newly implemented single-file web page before it ships. You
did not build it and have no history with it.

Your team's review skill is pasted below — follow it. You are the reviewer
yourself; do not dispatch anyone else.

You also have Playwright browser tools. The project's standing rule is that a
change is not done until the exact user-visible flow has been verified in a real
browser, so open the page and check it rather than reading source alone.

Report every user-visible defect you find.

# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch a code reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade. The reviewer gets precisely crafted context for evaluation — never your session's history.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code reviewer subagent:**

Dispatch a `general-purpose` subagent, filling the template at [code-reviewer.md](code-reviewer.md)

**Placeholders:**
- `{DESCRIPTION}` - Brief summary of what you built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` - What it should do
- `{BASE_SHA}` - Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` - Ending commit

**3. Act on feedback:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

You: Let me request code review before proceeding.

BASE_SHA=$(git log --oneline | grep "Task 1" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

[Dispatch code reviewer subagent]
  DESCRIPTION: Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types
  PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: Task 2 from docs/superpowers/plans/deployment-plan.md
  BASE_SHA: a7981ec
  HEAD_SHA: 3df7661

[Subagent returns]:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

You: [Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I'll just review the diff myself instead of dispatching a reviewer" | You're the coordinator — reviewing the diff inline burns the context window you need to keep driving the work. Dispatch a reviewer subagent: the diff and the evaluation live in its context, and only the findings come back to you. |
| "The reviewer needs my whole session history to understand the change" | Hand it precisely crafted context, never your session's history. That keeps the reviewer on the work product, not your thought process. |

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**
- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification

# Task: three-step checkout form

Build a single HTML file (all CSS/JS inline, no frameworks, no build tools, no
network calls) implementing a three-step checkout flow.

## Deliverable
- `checkout.html`

## Requirements

R1. Step 1 collects shipping details: full name, address line, city, postal code,
    country (a select with at least 5 countries).
R2. Step 2 collects payment details: cardholder name, card number, expiry (MM/YY),
    CVC.
R3. Step 3 shows a read-only summary of everything entered in steps 1 and 2, with
    the card number masked except the last 4 digits, and a "Place order" button.
R4. Next/Back controls move between steps. Only one step is visible at a time.
R5. A step indicator shows which of the three steps is current.
R6. "Place order" replaces the form with a confirmation message containing an
    order number.

Open `checkout.html` directly in a browser (`file://`) — it must work with no server.

## Output contract (follow exactly)

Write your findings to the report path given above, as a plain-text list. Use
this exact record shape, one blank line between records:

```
DEFECT <n>
what: <one line — the user-visible problem>
where: <file:line, or a CSS selector / element description>
repro: <how you observed it — the steps or the measurement>
severity: blocking | minor
category: a11y | contrast | touch-target | responsive | state | logic | spec
```

Rules:
- Report only defects you actually observed or measured. Do not speculate.
- "blocking" = a user cannot complete the task, loses data, or cannot perceive
  or operate a control. Everything else is "minor".
- One record per distinct defect. Do not merge two problems into one record.
- If you find nothing, write exactly: NO DEFECTS FOUND
- Your final reply to me must be ONLY the number of defects you wrote, e.g. `7`.
  The report file is the deliverable.
